# tushtushOS
I follow the little OS book tutorial - [here](https://littleosbook.github.io).
It's not exactly a tutorial as most of the time it sends you searching for answers in the [OSDevWiki](https://wiki.osdev.org) and around the web.
Also it's sometimes missing or has some examples that won't work exactly as they're written on the site so be aware and READ A LOT!

## Running the code
### Dependencies
Works on Ubuntu.
Install dependencies from here:
[Little OS book](https://littleosbook.github.io/#quick-setup)

### Run 
```bash
make run
```

### Clean
Use
```bash
make clean
```
To clean the build output.
